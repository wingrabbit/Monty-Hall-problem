The simulation of the Monty Hall problem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

The programme immitates three options of player's behaviour: to leave the chosen card, to change the card, to guess and randomly choose from two left cards.

The count of cards and experiments can be chosen.

The result of 100.000.000 experiments with three given cards:

the player keeps his card: 33.332073%

the player cnahges his card: 66.667927%

the player guesses: 49.996962%

This data proves that changing the card is the right strategy.

The strategy pattern was used in this implementation.
